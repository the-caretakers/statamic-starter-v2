        text: " After countless design iterations, a far-too-long-running git branch finally merged, and at least one designer threatening to move to an island in the Caribbean to spend his or her days drinking Hurricanes in the sun..., we've launched the new Statamic.com. Sure, it looks prettier and more sophisticated while keeping it's quirky roots, and yes the user experience is much more intuitive, but the real magic is in all the new features we've packed into every area of the site."
